# shuttle-app

In this project, I used NYC taxi trips public dataset to investigate possible improvements to transportation. The idea is to identify similar rides (in terms of starting and ending locations, as well as pick-up times), and grouping them together to schedule a shuttle service. I used K-Means clustering algorithm to group the trips together, and analyzed what percentage of the rides can be potentially reduced by this approach.

The dataset can be found at
